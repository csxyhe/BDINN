# Description

The complete code is coming soon!



## what is shown now!

**A plug-and-play banded deformable convolutional layer** significantly reduces the number of learnable parameters compared to standard deformable convolutional layers, providing **a more efficient and stable alternative** for training.

The implementation is **fully based on PyTorch**, making it easy to integrate and use. Feel free to give it a try!



### Requirements

```bash
torch>=1.9.0
torchvision>=0.10.0
```
